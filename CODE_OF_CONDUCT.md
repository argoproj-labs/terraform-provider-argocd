# Code of conduct

While this provider is not a [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/) (CNCF) project, it supports, endorses, and
echoes the code of conduct presented by the CNCF. The CNCF code of conduct can be found
[here](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md). Full credit goes to the CNCF project for
establishing the linked code of conduct principles.

Instances of behaviors that are not aligned with the values proposed by CNCF can be reported to the repository admins via Github's reporting feature.
See [Reporting Abuse or Spam](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/maintaining-your-safety-on-github/reporting-abuse-or-spam) for details how to do so.
