# argocd_repository_credentials (Resource)

Manages [repository credentials](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/private-repositories/#credentials) within ArgoCD.

**Note**: due to restrictions in the ArgoCD API the provider is unable to track drift in this resource to fields other than `username`. I.e. the provider is unable to detect changes to repository credentials that are made outside of Terraform (e.g. manual updates to the underlying Kubernetes Secrets).

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "argocd_repository_credentials" "private" {
  url             = "git@private-git-repository.local"
  username        = "git"
  ssh_private_key = "-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----\nfoo\nbar\n-----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `url` (String) URL that these credentials match to

### Optional

- `enable_oci` (Boolean) Whether `helm-oci` support should be enabled for this repo
- `githubapp_enterprise_base_url` (String) GitHub API URL for GitHub app authentication
- `githubapp_id` (String) GitHub App ID of the app used to access the repo for GitHub app authentication
- `githubapp_installation_id` (String) ID of the installed GitHub App for GitHub app authentication
- `githubapp_private_key` (String, Sensitive) Private key data (PEM) for authentication via GitHub app
- `password` (String, Sensitive) Password for authenticating at the repo server
- `ssh_private_key` (String, Sensitive) Private key data for authenticating at the repo server using SSH (only Git repos)
- `tls_client_cert_data` (String) TLS client cert data for authenticating at the repo server
- `tls_client_cert_key` (String, Sensitive) TLS client cert key for authenticating at the repo server
- `username` (String) Username for authenticating at the repo server

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Repository credentials identifier

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
# Repository credentials can be imported using the repository URL.

# Note: as the ArgoCD API does not return any sensitive information, a
# subsequent `terraform apply` should be executed to make the `password`,
# `ssh_private_key` and `tls_client_cert_key` attributes converge to their
# expected values defined within the plan.

terraform import argocd_repository_credentials.myrepocreds git@private-git-repository.local:somerepo.git
```
