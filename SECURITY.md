# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability 

We have enabled the ability to privately report security issues through the  Security tab above.

[Here are the details on how to file a new vulnerability](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability#privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).

A repository owner/maintainer will respond as fast as possible to coordinate confirmation of the issue and remediation.

Thank you for helping to ensure this code stays secure!
