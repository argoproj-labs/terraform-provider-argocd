# ArgoCD Provider

The ArgoCD Provider provides lifecycle management of
[ArgoCD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) resources.

**NB**: The provider is not concerned with the installation/configuration of
ArgoCD itself. To make use of the provider, you will need to have an existing
ArgoCD installation.

The correct provider configuration largely depends on whether or not your 
ArgoCD API server is exposed or not.

If your ArgoCD API server is exposed, then:
- use `server_addr` along with a `username`/`password` or `auth_token`. 
- use `use_local_config` if you have (pre)authenticated via the ArgoCD CLI (E.g.
  via SSO using `argocd login --sso`.

If you have not exposed your ArgoCD API server or have not deployed the API
server ([ArgoCD
core](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/installation/#core)),
see below for options. **Note**: in both these cases, you need sufficient access
to the Kubernetes API to perform any actions.
- use `port_forward_with_namespace` and optionally `kubernetes` configuration
  (to temporarily expose the ArgoCD API server using port forwarding) along with
  a `username`/`password` or `auth_token`.
- use `core` to run a local ArgoCD API server that communicates directly with
  the Kubernetes API. **NB**: When using `core`, take note of the warning in 
  the docs below.

If you are struggling to determine the correct configuration for the provider or
the provider is behaving strangely and failing to connect for whatever reason,
then we would suggest that you first figure out what combination of parameters
work to log in using the ArgoCD CLI (`argocd login`) and then set the provider
configuration to match what you used in the CLI. See also the ArgoCD [Getting
Started](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/#3-access-the-argo-cd-api-server)
docs.
